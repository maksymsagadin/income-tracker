## Introduction
Created a Personal Finance Tracker Application. Implemented Speechly API to allow a user to add transactions using their voice in order to remove the tedious clicking that comes with adding multiple transaction, as well as Chart.js to allows users to see a breakdown of their finances in a easy to understand visual Doughnut Chart.

## Future Plans
- Implement a selection feature to look at other types of visual charts that Chart.js.
- Set up backend to have User/Account creation and store transactions on Mongo.db
